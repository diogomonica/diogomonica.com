I first heard about MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) in 2007 when I met [Olivier Bonaventure](http://perso.uclouvain.be/olivier.bonaventure/blog/html/index.html) in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

In the meantime MPTCP has been gaining a ton of traction, from having Apple using it for Siri on [iOS](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/091913-ios7-multipath-273995.html) to large loadbalancer vendors like F5 [supporting it](https://devcentral.f5.com/questions/is-mptcp-supported) and even large-scale media [covering it's advantages](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/09/multipath-tcp-lets-siri-seamlessly-switch-between-wi-fi-and-3glte/).

If you want a primer on MPTCP you should check out the suprisingly readable [RFC](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6824), or even [this article](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2591369) by Olivier Bonaventure. There is also a ton of information on the Linux Kernel MultiPath TCP project [multipath-tcp.org](http://www.multipath-tcp.org/).

Anyway, the point of this post is to share a Security oriented presentation that I did on a MPTCP a while back. Enjoy.
